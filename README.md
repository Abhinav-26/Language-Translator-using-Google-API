# Language-Translator-using-Google-API
In this project I build a language translator which can be used to convert any language to another language. For building this I used google API which reduced the burden and it easy to build and use.

# API 
API stands for Application Programming Interface. It acts as an intermediate between two applications or software. In simple terms, API acts as a messenger that takes your request to destinations and then brings back its response for you. Google API is developed by Google to allow communications with their servers and use their API keys to develop projects.

# Dependencies
1. pip3 install pyaudio
2. pip3 install SpeechRecognition
3. pip3 install gtts

# Application
Let’s assume a scenario, we are traveling in Spain and we don’t know how to speak Spanish or we are in any other country and we don’t know their native language, then we can use this tool to overcome the problem. We can translate between all those languages which are present in google translator.

# How to use Application ?
In terminal write : python3 translator.py

If using IDLE then open translator.py file and run it. Supports.py contains the code by which you can see how many languages does google api supports and then short forms which can be used in application.
